# About Donald Calculation port
### This will be my second project in the Full Stack Developing Diploma Course at the Code Institute. This is a website which is used for easy calculation where instead of using clicked numbers and other tabs you can simply just input the numbers on the two boxes and pick the operator to get a desired value. Inclusive here is also scientific calculation 

# Website
[Visit the website]() [,explore the page, and do calculation ](https://lionkiller900.github.io/test/)

# UX 
### This project is meant to give an easy acess of calculator 
## User stories
This website is useful because:
- It is easy to simply input numbers and choose an operator
- Its easily downloadable
- The page is noticeable in the outlook containing mathematically information.
- Instead of the normal calculator outlook containing the operator buttons this will simply have a drop list that is easy for the individual to pick any operator.

## Mockups
This is a one page website. This hence makes it easy to use. This is because a basic scientific calculator with more mathematical operators not seen in most calculator.

## Wireframing
This is a one-page wireframe sketch.[Here it is](https://0oba3a.db.files.1drv.com/y4ma1V3Z2Fj2qjXS2tVui_07B9jjHjSDamaAZoB2q5lJWyCJAvbU7Z5WimX_0ZmvM5Q4pSt3jn7dWr5cGwJBx6nwIbsWue1bJGGezdaWNQPdCJerXooriUOnXd3B95ioT41MssX4yrj-nXH5L4gmLhL7IxNYwtuqKf-bUURmvAfw6_pypkd2ok3AjzWbkVlf0_NxmkD2IG076ULXD6vd0N4rQ?width=1106&height=865&cropmode=none)

### Features
As we may know it, this is a project were Javascript is utilised to create a calculator. To be more sure of how this work was sketched see the screenshot of both Javascript and the HTML:
